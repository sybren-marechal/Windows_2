## Conclusion Michiel Meyfroodt

_A brief conclusion of my participation in this Windows server 2016 project._

I think I can say that we \(and I speak for each student\) had a difficult, slow start at the beginning of this semester. Maybe this is due to the long vacation and that we had to refresh our knowledge of Windows Server 2016. But things got better later in this project, Sybren started working on his PowerShell script, Aython took care of the member server and I used to solve the weekly tasks and take care of the domain controller.

We managed to get a full working Windows environment that can be used in real life.  
I think it was an excellent idea to work with the characters of '_het eiland_' because they represent a small company with different "islands" where different persons used to work. It is fun to work on this project if you've seen this series.

During the project we had some difficulties and had stress. There had to be done a lot of troubleshooting \(special thanks to Mr. Cordemans for helping us out in difficult moments\), there were problems with GitBook and we had different errors that were probably due to the fact that we had to set up our servers and break this set-up in a timescale of three hours. Servers need to stabilize in a working environment.

**Conclusion**: I am happy with the final result, all my tasks were successfully completed and Sybren his PowerShell script works. Sadly there were some problems with the WSUS-server in the end of our project but that was Aython his part. I wasn't able to help him because of the small amount of time we had and I had to clear up our logbook and add more documentation.
